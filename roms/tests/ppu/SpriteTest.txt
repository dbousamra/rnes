SpriteTest 1.0
==============

This is a very simple test-ROM for NES aimed at emulator-developers to test their sprites.
This ROM is tested on actual hardware (PAL NES) and works.

Usage
=====
When starting this ROM you hopefully see two sprites in the center of the screen ("01"). They
have the same tile-ID's as displayed on screen.

Press SELECT to switch between 8x8/8x16 spritemode.
Press B to set horizontal-flip mode
Press A to set vertical-flip mode
Press D-Pad to move the sprites around (just for fun? :))

Yellow sprites indicates that they're fetched from patterntable 0. When they turn green
(8x16 mode) they're fetched from patterntable 1.
